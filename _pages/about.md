Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Operations and Decision Sciences area at the Lazaridis School of Business and Economics, Wilfrid Laurier University.   As a researcher, I aim to utilize statistical learning and stochastic control methods to address challenges inherent in data-driven decision-making, especially within service operations and revenue management applications. My recent research has focused on improving decision-making in complex information-sharing environments. (e.g., misinformation, strategic behaviors). Details can be found [here](https://xyz2023ca.github.io/publications/).

I received my PhD in Management Science from the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, where I was advised by Prof. Michael Jong Kim. Before that, I earned a Master of Applied Science in Operations Research from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics from McGill University.



You can find my CV [here](https://xyz2023ca.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_2025.pdf).

Below, you'll discover information about my recent talks and what's upcoming. 






<!---My main research interests are in Bayesian learning and stochastic control. In particular,  I am interested in the interplay of strategic incentives and optimal leanring  with applications in revenue management and healthcare.
